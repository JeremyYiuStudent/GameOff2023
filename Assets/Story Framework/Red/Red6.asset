  description: "I nearly lost control today again. I hate this feeling. I hate how
    easily I give in to anger. I feel like I\u2019m not myself when I get too angry,
    and that scares me. If only there was a way for me to not be so angry all the
    time\u2026. What has being angry ever helped me with? "
