    Oh god. I shouldn\u2019t have hurt John like that. I mean, he\u2019s a dick,
    but he doesn\u2019t deserve that. I could have just gotten a teacher to handle
    it. The look of fear in his eyes. <br>It\u2019s like he was looking at a monster. 
    <br>I knew this would happen one day. I knew it. This anger of mine is going
    to fuck me up. I don\u2019t want it. Please, I don\u2019t want to feel angry
    anymore.  "
