  description: "John was being an asshole at school today again. He is always cocky
    like that. As if he is better than everyone else in the room. So what if he comes
    from a rich family? With that attitude, sooner or later he will get into trouble
    in life.  Whatever, I shouldn\u2019t even be wasting my thoughts thinking about
    him. I have math homework I gotta work on. Hope I do well in the exam next week.  "
