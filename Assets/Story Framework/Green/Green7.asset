  description: 'This is a monitoring satellite. It uses its cameras onboard to monitor
    the surface, and microwave transmitters to send said data down to the surface
    for use in satellite imaging and mapping, along with other purposes. This information
    is freely available for the public to use as a public utility and good. It powers
    itself with solar panels, impressive for such a large wonder of modern science.
    Now, it has found a new frontier of which to explore and image: the floor of
    an office building, which it captures in picture-perfect accuracy, down to the
    thousandth of an inch.'
