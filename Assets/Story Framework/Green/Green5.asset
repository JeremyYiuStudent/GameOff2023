  description: A bookcase full of books neatly organized into categories and by date.
    The first few rows are collections of accounting documents, annual reports, inventory
    binders, and balance sheets, all of which pertain to Denver Communications Technology
    Industries and its clients. The final row is mostly empty, except for a few textbooks
    covering physics, electrophysics, electromagnetic physics, single-variable calculus,
    and computer networking.
