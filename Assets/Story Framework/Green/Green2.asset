  name: Faux Tree
  description: This tree is made of plastic. The interior designer insisted on a
    real tree, but it brought in insects and it smelled bad, so it was replaced with
    this. It still looks like the original tree though, but at least insects don't
    eat it. There are branches pulled off because kids tore up the leaves and the
    managers never replaced it.
