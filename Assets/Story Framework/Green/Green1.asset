  - text: Hello and welcome, we regret to inform you that the upper floors of Denver
      Communications Technology Industries Offices are no longer in service.
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: As you may be aware the upper floors were recently impacted.
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: We remind you that we are currently in the process of cleaning up the building,
      you may enter the lower floors but for now please do not access the floors
      above and including floor 35.
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: As they are potentially hazardous, while the building is structurally sound
      please do not attempt to access the machine.
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: Thank you for your cooperation with Denver Communications Technology Industries
      protocol and we appreciate your business.
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: Oh, are you new here? Are you here to survey the upper floors?
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: They said they would have some guys come in this week. We haven't had anyone
      come look at the wreckage in years, so I'm surprised Gabe still gives a shit.
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: You can take the elevator straight to the top. From there it's all on you.
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: 'The wreck has been there for... I believe now seven years? '
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: Upper management has never really dealt with it, they were more interested
      in keeping business rolling, and construction costs always balloon. Or something
      idk.
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: 'Managers are more concerned with leasing the offices for mega cheap even
      though they''re a safety hazard. '
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: State hasn't done shit because they're too busy handling crime or corruption
      or taxes or redistricting or whatever the fuck they're on about this week.
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: 'Oh right, the satellite- yeah, it''s been there for a while. '
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: 'I mean even with the hole in the roof the building''s been standing for
      7 years so we''re probably gonna be fine. '
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: It's like a hundred and fifty years old, it can survive a little satellite
      through the roof here and there, ya know?
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: It shouldn't be hazardous or anything, but tread carefully, obviously.
    speaker: Receptionist
  - text: Other than that, good luck! Don't die!
    speaker: Receptionist
